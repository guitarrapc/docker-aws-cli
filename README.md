## Installation guide

Simply pull the image from official docker hub using the following command as it contains nothing more than a set of open source tools.

```sh
docker pull guitarrapc/docker-awscli-kubectl
```

## Even more useful in Gitlab

- Please use docker enabled gitlab runner and make sure docker engine is running in priviledged mode to enable Docker inside Docker (DinD). Learn more? https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/executors/docker.html#use-docker-in-docker-with-privileged-mode
- Use the image as your builder image to be loaded into the runner during the build step initiation and enable DinD service. To acheive this please add the following snippet to your pipeline code i.e. gitlab-ci.yaml.

```yaml
docker:
    stage: create-docker-image
    image: guitarrapc/docker-awscli-kubectl
    services:
        - docker:dind
    variables:
        DOCKER_DRIVER: overlay           # For better build performance

    script:
        - echo 'Your build scripts goes here and you can use all of the above toolset'
```
